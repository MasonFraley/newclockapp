## Summary

My first "major" project using primarily Javascript, and formatted with HTML and CSS.

The more notable (and tricky) functions of the code involve nested functions to include leading zeros on the clock and some fun with variables and operators to accurately update the AM/PM indicator and the day suffix.

I spent a couple days soaking up the rudiments of the language and about 2 days grinding it out. A steep learning curve, but I feel that the project gave me a solid initial comfort level in working with the syntax and basic commands of Javascript, as well as integrating those with HTML and CSS. A great first project and a lot of fun! I'm very proud of the work.
